    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A California roll is a fresh take on traditional Japanese rice rolls.
      Filled with avocado, crab, and cucumber, it's fresh and crunchy and makes
      a filling meal. You can use real or imitation crab.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups uncooked white rice</li>
      <li>1/2 cup seasoned rice vinegar</li>
      <li>White sugar, salt</li>
      <li>1/4 pound cooked crab meat</li>
      <li>Mayonnaise</li>
      <li>5 sheets nori</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat
        to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has
        been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes. Transfer rice to a bowl and cut in
        vinegar using a rice paddle or wooden spoon. Season with sugar and salt.
        Allow to cool to room temperature, about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Combine crab meat with mayonnaise in a small bowl.</li>
      <li>
        Place nori sheet on a flat work surface. Spread a thin layer of rice on
        top of nori. Place nori, rice side down, on the prepared rolling mat.
        Place 2 to 3 avocado slices on top of the nori in one layer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Top with 2 to 3 tablespoons of the crab mixture.Spoon 1 to 2 teaspoons
        tobiko lengthwise on one side of the avocado-crab mixture, and 2
        cucumber strips on the other side.
      </li>
      <li>
        Using the mat as a guide, carefully roll the California roll into a
        tight log. Remove the rolling mat. Top roll with more tobiko, cover with
        plastic wrap, and gently press the tobiko into the top of the roll
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the plastic and cut into 6 even pieces using a wet knife. Repeat
        with remaining sheets of nori and filling. Serve garnished with pickled
        ginger, soy sauce, and wasabi paste.
