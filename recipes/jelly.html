    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This coffee jelly is a refreshing Japanese summertime treat made with
      coffee, powdered gelatin, and sugar. My favorite way to serve it is with
      frozen whipped cream and chocolate sauce, although it's also delicious
      with ice cream, regular whipped cream, or flavored coffee cream. It can be
      served solid in glasses or cubed in bowls.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tbsp hot water</li>
      <li>1 package unflavored gelatin</li>
      <li>2 cups fresh brewed coffee</li>
      <li>3 tbsp white sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Stir together gelatin and hot water in a small bowl until gelatin
        dissolves; pour into a saucepan. Stir in coffee and sugar, and bring to
        a boil over high heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour coffee mixture into a shallow, 9-inch square or 7x11-inch baking
        dish. Chill in the refrigerator until solidified, 6 to 7 hours.
